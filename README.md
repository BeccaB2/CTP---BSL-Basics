# CTP---BSL-Basics
*Please note that the menu is mouse operated.
# Equipment & software:
To run the project, you will need a Leap Motion controller to enable the hands to be tracked.
You will also need to download the V4 Orion SDK for the controller from the following link:
https://developer.leapmotion.com/setup/desktop

The device should then be plugged into a machine using the longest USB cable that is provided.

To ensure that the mounted mode functions as intended, the controller will need to be affixed to a mount
that can be elevated to the height of the user’s head, the controller should be able to see the hands.
Please refer to the setup advice detailed below for more guidance on positioning the device.

It is recommended to use a head strap to do this, the strap that was used for testing can be purchased
from Amazon. You must ensure that the controller is securely attached to the mount using an adhesive or
a material such as Velcro, whilst also taking care to ensure that no damage is caused to the device.

# Setup advice:
## Desktop mode
For the desktop mode, ensure that the controller is placed on a stable surface, the cable should be to the
left of the device and the green light should be facing the user. The user should place their hands just
above the controller, with their palms facing the sensor.

It is suggested that the user should sit at a desk to use the controller as this will provide both a stable
surface and a comfortable position for using the device.

## Mounted mode
The device should be securely attached to a mount, the green light should face upwards. It is
recommended to use a mount that enables the device to be attached to the head as this will provide the
best field of view.

The device can be secured to a mount using adhesive strips, if using a head strap, adjust the straps to
ensure comfort. It is recommended that the user is sat down whilst using the device.

# Leap Motion guidance:
The functionality of the Leap Motion may be affected by the conditions it is placed within; poor lighting,
smudges, reflective surfaces, and obstructions near/on the hands all impact the accuracy of tracking.

To ensure that the Leap has the best chance of recognising the positioning of the hands, roll up any long
sleeves and remove pieces of jewellery that may be obstructing the sensor’s view of the hand.

Regular cleaning of the front of the device with a soft, clean cloth is also recommended as any smudges or
collections of dirt are likely to affect how much the sensor can see.

It is also worth considering how environmental lighting may influence the quality of tracking, ensure that
the sensor is placed in an environment that is not too bright or reflective.

## Troubleshooting advice:
If the hand/fingers seem to be buggy or mixed up, try removing the hands away from the view of the
sensors and slowly moving them back to the original position.

If difficulties with jumpiness/accuracy persist, the sensors may benefit from being recalibrated, this can be
done via the control panel for the Leap Motion.

To do this, find the icon for the Leap and open the control panel, this should be located on the taskbar of
the device you are using. On this control panel, navigate to the troubleshooting tab and select the option
to recalibrate the device by following the instructions provided.

The status of the Leap Motion is also displayed on the taskbar icon, the colour green indicates that the
controller and software is working as expected.

If the colour of the icon is not green or you are experiencing connection problems, please refer to the
following link as a guide to troubleshoot any issues that occur: https://support.leapmotion.com/hc/enus/articles/360004321178-Troubleshooting-Guide
